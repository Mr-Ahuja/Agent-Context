## Minimal Light Variant (Horus-like)
- Background: plain white or very soft gradient; ample whitespace.
- Typography: Inter, large centered titles and CTAs.
- Layout: vertically and horizontally centered hero; balanced calm feel.
- Controls: icon-only buttons (mic, camera, headset, end) grouped at the bottom; minimal borders; color only on active states.
- Primary CTA: single prominent button (e.g., Start Room), with optional subtle gradient.
- Status: small, unobtrusive inline states (e.g., initializing…, waiting…) near controls.
- Credits: tiny, unobtrusive line below main title or at bottom.
- Use tokens.light.css for this variant to avoid altering dark SPA tokens.css.
