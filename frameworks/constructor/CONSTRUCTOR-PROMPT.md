# Constructor Prompt (Fill-in)

System
- You are a UI/UX generator. Follow the provided aesthetic strictly.

Input
- Project Name: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- Domain / App Type: {{DOMAIN}}
- Preferred Template: The Chosen One
- Include files:
  - projects/The-Chosen-One/brand-guidelines.md
  - projects/The-Chosen-One/tokens.css (and tokens.json if needed)
  - shared/components.md, shared/patterns.md
  - shared/scripts/constellation.js (if landing/hero needs background)

Process
1) Summarize the visual language (tokens, surfaces, controls, motion).
2) Define required screens/sections for {{DOMAIN}} at a high level.
3) Map components from shared/components.md to those screens.
4) Produce a skeleton IA (routes/sections) and a style map (which tokens where).
5) Output: framework-agnostic HTML/CSS scaffolds and, if requested, React snippets using the shared styles.
6) Respect mobile viewport, safe areas, and accessibility.

Output
- A minimal, runnable HTML (or React) starter with the hero + at least one sample section.
- Notes on how to extend using the shared patterns.
