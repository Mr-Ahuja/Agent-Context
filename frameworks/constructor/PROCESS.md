# Template Creation Process

1) Choose base template (The Chosen One) and import its tokens.
2) Declare domain constraints (e.g., dashboard, marketing, utility).
3) List core components used and any deltas (e.g., link color, CTA gradient).
4) Produce starter pages: landing, primary action, and a content card.
5) Verify responsiveness, color contrast, and motion preferences.
